##- Solving a differential with Sympy diff()
#Importing sympy
from sympy import *
# create a "symbol" called x
x = Symbol('x')
#Define function
f = x**2
#Calculating Derivative
derivative_f = f.diff(x)
derivative_f

#Calculate the derivative of the function at x = 2 sympy has lambdify function in which we pass the symbol and the function.
from sympy import *
#create a "symbol" called x
x = Symbol('x')
#Define function
f = x**2
f1 = lambdify(x, f)
#passing x=2 to the function
f1(2)
